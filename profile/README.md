It’s the closest thing there is to a universal genre. That’s because, with rare exceptions, everyone falls in love, or at least wants to. And when you think about it, almost every 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 is a love story. Thrillers, comedies, sci-fi — no matter what the form, the spectacle of two people falling in love in the middle of it has always been what makes the world of 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 go round. That’s why choosing the greatest 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 love stories presents a special challenge. Because really, what isn’t a contender? In a way, Set in 1963 but oh-so-’80s in its idea of hairstyles and heartthrobs, this sexy summer-camp romance defied its critics to become a classic. Nicknaming Jennifer Grey’s character “Baby” went a long way to illustrate what’s really going on here: The teenage daughter of conservative Jewish parents is forever being infantilized by her folks, until she meets a slightly older — but undeniably adult — dance teacher (Patrick Swayze) who shows her the time of her life. Corrupted by rock ’n’ roll, Baby grows up fast, getting over her initial shyness (“I carried a watermelon”) while rehearsing with her seductive instructor, who practices a racy new style of close-contact, ultra-suggestive moves that can only be read as carnal. Like “Rebel Without a Cause” and “Grease” before it, the 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 plays on the fantasy of an off-limits attraction between Baby and the bad boy. — Peter Debruge though, we kept our criteria simple. We were looking for grand passion, for chemistry and heat and all that good stuff. Yet there’s an ineffable quality that elevates a truly great 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 romance. Let’s call it the Swoon Factor. It’s about the swoon that happens onscreen; it’s about the swoon that happens between the audience and the screen. What follows are the 50 𝑭𝒊𝒍𝒎𝒔 that, more than any others, got our hearts racing.    
Just rewatched both, 1st is a classic, but wow the 2nd one has really aged so fucking well.

You may well be surprised by the things we excluded, including 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 with great action scenes (like “Dirty Harry” or Marvel 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔) that ultimately fell slightly outside the genre, while others that might not have been marketed as action 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 per se (such as Paul Greengrass’ greatest film) made the cut. “Cut,” of course, is the action word that ends each take. So, without further ado, here’s Variety’s list of the 50 greatest action 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 of all time.

Writing a definitive list of the best comedy 𝑭𝒊𝒍𝒎𝒔 ever made is hard. Not only has the genre been around since the late 1800s, but there are many types of comedy 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔: rom-coms, screwballs, slapsticks. But sometimes, you just need a good laugh.Comedy is subjective, but some 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 are just funny … full stop. A great comedy can be rewatched, quoted and revisited. While you won’t find the highest-grossing comedy 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 on this list (it’s 2023’s Barbie, if you are wondering,) you will find box office titans and even a couple of commercial flops that achieved cult status after the fact.

This full list includes 𝑭𝒊𝒍𝒎𝒔 from the 1930s to 2010s, and directors such as Mel Brooks, Adam McKay, John Huges and Stanely Kubrick. While complying a best comedies list, it is essential to look at subgenres. Comedies on this list include satires, mockumentaries, dark humor, rom-coms, teen comedies and even a musical comedy. There are so many types of comedy; all can be done well in the right hands.

So, what makes something a “best comedy 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆?” The easy answer is that it has to be funny. However, it’s more than that. Great comedy 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 stand the test of time. Comedy, as a genre, has a reputation for aging poorly to the point that many critics ask, can comedy age well? Many comedies pull off this feat and become classics. These classics come with endlessly quotable lines, iconic scenes, and jokes that we want to watch again and again.

Now, when it comes to the all-time greatest action 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔, the bar is set considerably higher. Reading through Variety’s list, you’ll learn a thing or two about how the form has evolved over the years. Arnold, Sly and Bruce (both Lee and Willis) each left their mark. But Chuck Norris and Burt Reynolds have been eclipsed, since every film on this list had to stand the test of time. We love Shaw Brothers classics, for example (“King Blood” and “The 36th Chamber of Shaolin” came close), but martial arts 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒔 have evolved so much that other titles took their place.

Namely, John Wick's fight scenes are highly stylized, leveraging both the character's evident martial arts training and the sleek settings of luxury he finds himself in to deliver a visual feast every time. The real challenge for the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is to live up to this, although given Ana de Armas' experience with No Time to Die, it is certainly possible. John Wick is another action title that occupies such a space in cultural consciousness that everyone should see it once to see what it's all about.
